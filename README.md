This project is based on how to reduce carbon emission, in which we combined solar pannel and cotoneaster. 
The cotoneaster is a plant which have the capacity to absorb more carbon (i.e. 50% more) then the other usual plant.
This can be used at the places where there is more emission of carbon dioxide. 
so, to overcome this, we thought of combining the both the properties and use them for the carbon emission.
